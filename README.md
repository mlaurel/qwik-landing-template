## Demo

ðŸ“Œ [https://qwind.pages.dev/](https://qwind.pages.dev/)

<br>

## Getting started

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just a extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

### Project structure

Inside **Qwind** template, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ adaptors/
|   â””â”€â”€ static/
|       â””â”€â”€ vite.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ robots.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   |   |   â”œâ”€â”€ post-slug-1.md
â”‚   |   |   â”œâ”€â”€ post-slug-2.md
â”‚   |   |   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
|   |   â””-- service-worker.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.mjs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entry.dev.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entry.preview.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entry.ssr.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ root.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command            | Action                                         |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`      | Installs dependencies                          |
| `npm run dev`      | Starts local dev server at `127.0.0.1:5173/`   |
| `npm run build`    | Build your production site to `./dist/`        |
| `npm run preview`  | Preview your build locally, before deploying   |
| `npm run fmt`      | Format codes with Prettier                     |
| `npm run lint`     | Run Eslint                                     |
| `npm run qwik ...` | Run CLI commands like `qwik add`, `qwik build` |

<br>

### Configuration

Basic configuration file: `./src/config.mjs`

```javascript
export const SITE = {
  name: "Example",

  origin: "https://example.com",
  basePathname: "/", // Change this if you need to deploy to Github Pages, for example
  trailingSlash: true, // Generate permalinks with or without "/" at the end
};
```

<br>

### Deploy

#### Deploy to production (manual)

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build
```

Now, your website is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at
`dist` folder, which you can deploy the folder to any hosting service you
prefer.

#### Deploy to Netlify

## Netlify

This starter site is configured to deploy to [Netlify Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/), which means it will be rendered at an edge location near to your users.

### Local development

The [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) can be used to preview a production build locally. To do so: First build your site, then to start a local server, run:

1. Install Netlify CLI globally `npm i -g netlify-cli`.
2. Build your site with both ssr and static `npm run build`.
3. Start a local server with `npm run serve`.
   In this project, `npm run serve` uses the `netlify dev` command to spin up a server that can handle Netlify's Edge Functions locally.
4. Visit [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/) to check out your site.

### Edge Functions Declarations

[Netlify Edge Functions declarations](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/declarations/)
can be configured to run on specific URL patterns. Each edge function declaration associates
one site path pattern with one function to execute on requests that match the path. A single request can execute a chain of edge functions from a series of declarations. A single edge function can be associated with multiple paths across various declarations.

This is useful to determine if a page response should be Server-Side Rendered (SSR) or
if the response should use a static-site generated (SSG) `index.html` file instead.

By default, the Netlify Edge adaptor will generate a `.netlify/edge-middleware/manifest.json` file, which is used by the Netlify deployment to determine which paths should, and should not, use edge functions.

To override the generated manifest, you can [add a declaration](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/declarations/#add-a-declaration) to the `netlify.toml` using the `[[edge_functions]]` config. For example:

```toml
[[edge_functions]]
  path = "/admin"
  function = "auth"
```

### Deployments

You can [deploy your site to Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/) either via a Git provider integration or through the Netlify CLI. This starter site includes a `netlify.toml` file to configure your build for deployment.

#### Deploying via Git

Once your site has been pushed to your Git provider, you can either link it [in the Netlify UI](https://app.netlify.com/start) or use the CLI. To link your site to a Git provider from the Netlify CLI, run the command:

```shell
netlify link
```

This sets up [continuous deployment](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#deploy-with-git) for your site's repo. Whenever you push new commits to your repo, Netlify starts the build process..

#### Deploying manually via the CLI

If you wish to deploy from the CLI rather than using Git, you can use the command:

```shell
netlify deploy --build
```

You must use the `--build` flag whenever you deploy. This ensures that the Edge Functions that this starter site relies on are generated and available when you deploy your site.

Add `--prod` flag to deploy to production.
